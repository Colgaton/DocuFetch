DocuFetch is a way to bulk download all envelopes from your DocuSign account, as they don't offer a easy method to do it.

Keep in mind that:

* By default it downloads only completed envelopes
* Count is not implemented yet, so if you have dozens of documents, you might need to run it a couple times (and delete the downloaded files after each run)
* There are basically no error checking so double check the downloaded files to make sure they are ok
* If you have documents with the same name, it will overwrite them
* It works for me, YMMV.

To run it, use venv:

mkdir docs
python3 -m venv DocuFetch
cd DocuFetch
source bin/activate

Install the required libs using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

To capture the authentication cookies, run:

python capture_cookies.py

It will open a browser window and launch Docusign. Login to your account and click on "Completed". At this point it will grab the cookies and close the window automatically.

Now run:

python docufetch.py

It will try to login to your Docusign account, fetch the list of envelopes and start downloading them. It might take a while to it fully download everything.
